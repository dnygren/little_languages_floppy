Constructing Language Processors for Little Languages Floppy Disk

A copy of the contents of the floppy disk that accompanies the
book "Constructing Language Processors for Little Languages"
by Randy M. Kaplan. The floppy disk is a 3.5" MS-DOS formatted
disk. As it took some effort to find a machine to read the disk,
and then set up a dosbox to extract the contents, I'm provding
these files to others that have purchased a copy of the book. Book
purchasers are allowed to keep these files on a single computer
per the author's and publisher's copyright stated in the book.
